# NWS Weather CTk

This is a simple Python application written with customtkinter that fetches weather data from the National Weather Service. Simply enter your city name and postal code, and then click on **Get Weather**. The app will use geocoding and the NWS API to fetch current forecast data and active alerts for your region. 

If you want to change your location you can re-enter a new city and postal code, and then click on **Update Location** to set the new location.

This project was started for fun and educational purposes. Use this code however you like.
